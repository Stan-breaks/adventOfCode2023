# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenge.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual online event where participants solve a series of programming puzzles. Each day from December 1st to 25th, a new puzzle is released. Each puzzle has two parts, and you earn a star for each part you solve correctly.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized by day. Each day's puzzle solutions are in a separate directory named `dayXX`, where `XX` is the day of the month (01-25).

## Running the Solutions

Each solution is a standalone script. To run a solution, navigate to the appropriate directory and run the script using the appropriate command for your programming language.

## Progress

I'll update this section as I progress through the challenge.
